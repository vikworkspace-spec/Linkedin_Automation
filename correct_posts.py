You are a professional LinkedIn editor. Edit the following draft of 11 LinkedIn posts to make the following corrections:

1. In Post 4 (Unfair Advantage):
   - You MUST insert exactly one natural mention of "Zetabot AI". For example: "At Zetabot AI, we look for tools that give early teams an unfair advantage. S&P Global's new tool is one of them."

2. In Post 6 (Hot Take):
   - You MUST insert exactly one natural mention of "Zetabot AI". For example: "At Zetabot AI, we see this as a warning for founders. If model creators are rushing to go public for survival capital, relying on their low prices is risky."

3. Banned Word Cleanups:
   - In Post 2 (Poll), change "key developer" (since "key" as an adjective is banned) to "senior developer" or just "developer".
   - In Post 2 (AI News, which is Post 6 in the output list), change "supercharge AI research" to "accelerate AI research" or "support AI research".
   - In Post 7 (AI News, which is Post 11 in the output list), change "leverage AI" to "use AI".
   - Ensure the word "leverage", "leverages", "leveraging", "supercharge", "key" (as adjective), and other banned words from this list are NOT in the text: delve, underscore, vibrant, tapestry, interplay, intricate, garner, pivotal, showcase, foster, align with, landscape, leverages, encompasses, facilitates, utilized, commenced, subsequent to, prior to, in order to, stands as, serves as, is a testament to, plays a vital role, plays a significant role, plays a crucial role, enduring legacy, lasting impact, indelible mark, it's important to note, it's worth noting, no discussion would be complete without, moreover, furthermore, in addition, setting the stage for, marking a shift, evolving landscape, reflects broader trends, game-changer, supercharge, real results, real strategy, real conversations, disruptive, hustle, grind, crush it, synergy, paradigm shift, thought leader, go viral, revolutionary, groundbreaking, unprecedented, cutting-edge, state-of-the-art, next-generation, empower, unlock, journey, ecosystem, world-class, comprehensive, curated, innovative, transformative, passionate, excited to share.

4. Keep the exact output formatting, separators, and headings. Output ONLY the 11 posts, with no other text.
