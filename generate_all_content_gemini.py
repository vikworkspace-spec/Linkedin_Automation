WRITING RULES:
1. Third-person observer voice, no "I" or "my" or "we" statements. (Except in CTAs: "follow me for daily AI breakdowns", "follow me for more").
2. Exciting but grounded tone. Excitement should feel earned. Use sentence fragments, casual contractions, or conversational pivots.
3. No jargon: no LLM, parameters, tokens, inference, fine-tuning, multimodal, latency, hallucination, RAG, prompt engineering. Explain these concepts simply.
4. No em-dashes anywhere. Use normal commas, semicolons, or periods instead.
5. Do NOT include any headline, title, or header for the posts (like 'Headline: ...' or bold title lines). Start the content of the post directly with its first sentence/hook.
6. Post structure: Hook (1-2 lines) -> Pain point -> Actionable value -> Dream picture -> Engagement question -> CTA.
7. Banned words (NEVER USE ANY): delve, underscore, vibrant, tapestry, interplay, intricate, garner, pivotal, showcase, foster, align with, landscape, key (as adjective), leverages, encompasses, facilitates, utilized, commenced, subsequent to, prior to, in order to, stands as, serves as, is a testament to, plays a vital role, plays a significant role, plays a crucial role, enduring legacy, lasting impact, indelible mark, it's important to note, it's worth noting, no discussion would be complete without, moreover, furthermore, in addition, setting the stage for, marking a shift, evolving landscape, reflects broader trends, game-changer, supercharge, real results, real strategy, real conversations, disruptive, hustle, grind, crush it, synergy, paradigm shift, thought leader, go viral, revolutionary, groundbreaking, unprecedented, cutting-edge, state-of-the-art, next-generation, empower, unlock, journey, ecosystem, world-class, comprehensive, curated, innovative, transformative, passionate, excited to share.
8. Banned LinkedIn patterns:
   - "No X. No Y. Just Z."
   - "It's not just about X. It's about Y."
   - "If you're serious about X, [do this]"
   - "And here's the kicker"
   - "X changed everything"
   - "Enter:"
   - "The best part? [short answer]"
   - Email sign-off language ("To your success")
9. Banned contrast constructions:
   - "This isn't about X, it's about Y"
   - "Not because of X. But because of Y."
   - "Rather than X, do Y"
   - "But rather"
   - "Not just X, but also Y"
   - "Not only X, but Y"
10. Varied sentence lengths. Specific numbers over adjectives. No bullets where flowing prose works better.
